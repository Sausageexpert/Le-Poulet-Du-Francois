Main + entree - 

First, make the rich, creamy sauce by removing the white inside of the coconut and blending it. Add some coconut oil for the smoothness and a touch of milk to give it some consistency
Separate the sauce into two parts: One part should be reserved as a dressing, while the other should be used to marinate the chicken
Marinate the chicken and grill it on the hibachi. Once it acquires a light golden-brown color, take it off.
Now, make the glaze. Combine lemon zest and orange pulp, mix in some orange juice and blend to get a smooth, acidic sauce. Reserve the sauce as a dressing
Now, your entree should be some sausages, marinated in curd, cardamom, cinnamon and star anise, grilled slowly on low heat to get a good consistency
Once the sausages and the chicken are done, set them aside. Also store the dressings in separate glass bottles

Dessert - 

For dessert, take some dragonfruit and blend. Add milk to taste, and blend again. Mix thoroughly to get a good texture and add a bit more milk. Your dragonfruit curd is ready to go. Add some lemon to turn it into curd
Make a chocolate sphere by melting dark chocolate, blowing a balloon, coating it with the chocolate, letting it freeze and then popping the balloon. This requires a lot of precision and is extremely hard
Make a honey joy by taking some honey, turning it into a rich sauce by adding water and boiling for a while
 Also, melt some caramel and fill it in the chocolate sphere by cutting it in half. Make sure to close the sphere again and seal it with more chocolate
 After that, combine the elements. Make sure that plating is beautiful and elegant. Also drizzle a tiny bit of milk on top to add some lightness
 Once all the parts are ready, you can serve your customer. Make sure to dress the chicken well
